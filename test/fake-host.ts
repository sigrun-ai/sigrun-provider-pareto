/**
 * Settings fakes for the declared-settings suite (settings rework, Task 11).
 *
 * The host slice the factory takes is built here over an IN-MEMORY settings
 * document, with `settings.declare` implemented on core's REAL
 * `checkStoredSettings` — so "the defaults", "a malformed value falls back"
 * and "an old file still loads" are facts about the same code core runs, not
 * a hand-written stand-in. The repairs the checked read reports are recorded
 * because they are exactly what core turns into the admin notice
 * (`src/harness/seam-host.ts`: one `console.warn` per path plus one
 * `settings.invalid` notice), so a test can assert the notice's trigger
 * without re-implementing the notice.
 *
 * `declare` is SINGLE-SHOT, like core's: a second declaration on one host
 * throws, so a test that accidentally runs the factory twice over one fake
 * fails here instead of passing on behaviour real core rejects.
